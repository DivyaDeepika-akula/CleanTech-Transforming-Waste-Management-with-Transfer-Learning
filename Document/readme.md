*Project Report: CleanTech - Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning*
*Introduction:*
The project aims to develop an AI-powered waste management system using transfer learning, enabling efficient and accurate waste classification and sorting.

*Objectives:*
1. *Waste Classification*: Develop a model to classify waste into categories (organic, plastic, metal, etc.).
2. *Object Detection*: Identify and localize waste objects in images or videos.
3. *Waste Sorting*: Automate waste sorting processes using AI-powered systems.

*Methodology:*
1. *Data Collection*: Gather images of various waste types.
2. *Model Development*: Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., CNNs) and fine-tune for waste classification and object detection.
3. *Model Evaluation*: Assess model performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

*Results:*
1. *Accurate Classification*: Achieved high accuracy in waste classification.
2. *Efficient Sorting*: Developed a system for automated waste sorting.

*Conclusion:*
The project demonstrates the potential of transfer learning in transforming waste management. The developed system can improve waste classification, sorting, and recycling rates, contributing to a more sustainable environment.
